<h class="Setting">Place: Cambridge, MA; Ancient Rome</h>
<h class="Setting">Time: now; ancient past</h>

<h class="Stage">FAYE and TECHIYA are delivering a presentation at Fred Talks. The topic is their new video game, ‚ÄúMercury‚Äôs Messengers‚Äù. They are in front of a screen that reads Fred Talks.</h>
<h class="character">FAYE </h>
<h class="Scratch">After sharing Time Magazine‚Äôs Person of The Year title, we wondered, how could we possibly top ourselves?</h>
<h class="character">TECHIYA </h>
<h class="Scratch">We thought about doing something in 3D, something with body sensors, maybe even something unprecedented in how interactive it would be.</h>
<h class="character">FAYE</h>
<h class="Scratch">But instead, we thought about what really mattered. What, in a video game, do players really look for? And we decided that story, character, and the challenges are what make great video games.</h>
<h class="character">TECHIYA </h>
<h class="Scratch">Though I‚Äôm the music and sound designer, I still helped to brainstorm ideas.</h>
<h class="character">FAYE </h>
<h class="Scratch">After running through different ideas, different themes, different possibilities, we came upon one that we thought absolutely perfect, and Person of the Year worthy.</h>
<h class="character">TECHIYA </h>
<h class="Scratch">Ladies and gentlemen,</h>
<h class="Parenthetical">(Techiya points the clicker at the projector and clicks, revealing the artwork and images from the video game)</h>
<h class="Scratch"> we give you Mercury‚Äôs Messengers.</h>
<h class="Stage">The crowd goes wild.</h>
<h class="character">FAYE </h>
<h class="Scratch">In this game, set in Ancient Rome, Mercury and his gang of Messengers must complete tasks assigned to them by the gods. They must get through mazes, difficult puzzles, and figure out new ways of achieving their goals in order to please the gods and survive.</h>
<h class="character">TECHIYA </h>
<h class="Scratch">Boy, I‚Äôd hate to be in their winged shoes.</h>
<h class="character">FAYE </h>
<h class="Scratch">Lol, Techiya.</h>
<h class="character">TECHIYA </h>
<h class="Scratch">Thanks, girl.</h>
<h class="character">FAYE </h>
<h class="Scratch">So that‚Äôs our new game. We‚Äôve got a prototype ready to go in the Fred Arcade for everyone to enjoy.</h>
<h class="character">TECHIYA </h>
<h class="Scratch">Thanks for listening and enjoy the rest of the show!</h>
<h class="character">FAYE </h>
<h class="Scratch">You mean the talks.</h>
<h class="character">TECHIYA </h>
<h class="Scratch">Right, enjoy the rest of the talks.</h>
<h class="Stage">Faye and Techiya exit to raucous applause. They go backstage to celebrate. Their assistant, played by the same actor who will play Jupiter, enters.</h>
<h class="character">COLIN </h>
<h class="Scratch">That was fantastic. Couldn‚Äôt have gone any better even if you‚Äôd had Steve Jobs himself up there.</h>
<h class="character">FAYE </h>
<h class="Scratch">Thanks, Colin.</h>
<h class="character">COLIN </h>
<h class="Scratch">I‚Äôve got lots of fan mail for you guys, so much of it came in while you were speaking. Loads of tweets, emails, brand new Tumblr accounts, there‚Äôs even a Pinterest page dedicated to finding screencaps of the game.</h>
<h class="character">TECHIYA </h>
<h class="Scratch">Wow, that‚Äôs a bit overwhelming.</h>
<h class="character">COLIN </h>
<h class="Scratch">It‚Äôs just people wanting to celebrate your achievements and have fun with the games. I have a few messages from celebrities if you would like to hear them.</h>
<h class="character">FAYE </h>
<h class="Scratch">Yes, Colin.</h>
<h class="character">COLIN </h>
<h class="Scratch">Taylor Swift called and said she‚Äôs excited to bring this game out with her on her next tour.</h>
<h class="character">TECHIYA </h>
<h class="Scratch">I still can‚Äôt believe she and Jake Gyllanhaal broke up.</h>
<h class="character">FAYE </h>
<h class="Scratch">I still can‚Äôt believe she and Jake Gyllanhaal went out.</h>
<h class="character">COLIN </h>
<h class="Scratch">The Big Bang Theory wants to do some product placement on an upcoming episode.</h>
<h class="character">TECHIYA </h>
<h class="Scratch">Ooh, I love that show.</h>
<h class="character">FAYE </h>
<h class="Scratch">Me too, but when are they ever going to give some character development to Raj?</h>
<h class="character">COLIN </h>
<h class="Scratch">And a Mr. Justin Beiber has asked for Techiya‚Äôs hand in marriage.</h>
<h class="character">TECHIYA </h>
<h class="Scratch">Again?</h>
<h class="character">FAYE </h>
<h class="Scratch">Man, that boy is desperate. I do love his new song, though.</h>
<h class="character">TECHIYA </h>
<h class="Scratch">Tell Mr. Beiber I‚Äôm a little busy right now enjoying worldwide video game success and can‚Äôt be bothered to plan a wedding. Maybe next year.</h>
<h class="character">COLIN </h>
<h class="Scratch">And you also received a gift from an anonymous source, though his courier told me he is one of the biggest giants in the tech world.</h>
<h class="character">FAYE </h>
<h class="Scratch">That‚Äôs strange. What is it?</h>
<h class="character">COLIN </h>
<h class="Scratch">He said it‚Äôs Ambrosia, Miss Faye.</h>
<h class="character">TECHIYA </h>
<h class="Scratch">Hey, that‚Äôs the drink of the gods. How appropriate for our Mount Olympus set game.</h>
<h class="character">COLIN </h>
<h class="Scratch">I imagine it‚Äôs cranberry juice or something like that, since obviously Ambrosia doesn‚Äôt really exist.</h>
<h class="character">FAYE </h>
<h class="Scratch">Hmm. I could go for some cranberry juice.</h>
<h class="character">TECHIYA </h>
<h class="Scratch">Me too.</h>
<h class="Stage">Colin prepares two glasses for the girls and pours them the liquid.</h>
<h class="character">FAYE </h>
<h class="Scratch">Hey, Techiya, wouldn‚Äôt it be funny if this stuff really was Ambrosia and somehow sent us to Ancient Rome?</h>
<h class="character">TECHIYA</h>
<h class="Scratch">That, Miss Faye, is the most ridiculous thing I‚Äôve ever heard. Cheers!</h>
<h class="Stage">They clink glasses and drink.</h>
<h class="character">FAYE </h>
<h class="Scratch">Hey, I don‚Äôt know if this is really cranberry juice. I‚Äôm starting to feel funny.</h>
<h class="character">TECHIYA</h>
<h class="Scratch">Me too.</h>
<h class="character">COLIN </h>
<h class="Scratch">Miss Faye? Miss Techiya?</h>
<h class="character">FAYE </h>
<h class="Scratch">Colin, call 911, I think I‚Äôm going to-</h>
<h class="Stage">Whoosh! The lights flicker, a loud sound is heard. Blackout. Lights up. Faye and Techiya are now in Ancient Rome. Techiya is suddenly only able to sing. They are, understandably, very confused.</h>
<h class="character">Faye</h>
<h class="Scratch"> </h>
<h class="Scratch">What happened? What‚Äôs going on?</h>
<h class="character">TECHIYA </h>
<h class="Scratch">I don‚Äôt know, where did we go?</h>
<h class="character">Faye</h>
<h class="Scratch">What-wait, why are you singing?</h>
<h class="character">TECHIYA </h>
<h class="Scratch">I can only croon, all my words are in tune.</h>
<h class="character">FAYE </h>
<h class="Scratch">Why are we in front of mountains? And why does everything look so...animated?</h>
<h class="Parenthetical">(spots a passerby)</h>
<h class="Scratch"> Hey, you, I demand to know what‚Äôs going on!</h>
<h class="character">FLAVIA </h>
<h class="Scratch">What do you mean?</h>
<h class="character">FAYE </h>
<h class="Scratch">What do I mean? I mean what has happened to me? Just a moment ago I was standing and having a drink of some certainly expired cranberry juice and now I‚Äôm...here, wherever here is. Surrounded by mountains and people in togas.</h>
<h class="Parenthetical">(looks down)</h>
<h class="Scratch"> Oh my goodness, I‚Äôm in a toga! Who did this to me?!</h>
<h class="character">FLAVIA </h>
<h class="Scratch">You did. That is what you always wear.</h>
<h class="character">FAYE </h>
<h class="Scratch">Wait- what I always wear. Does that mean you know me?</h>
<h class="character">FLAVIA </h>
<h class="Scratch">Of course I do. Every person here knows you.</h>
<h class="character">FAYE </h>
<h class="Scratch">I‚Äôm Faye.</h>
<h class="character">FLAVIA</h>
<h class="Scratch">Ha, don‚Äôt be so silly. You‚Äôre Mercury.</h>
<h class="character">FAYE </h>
<h class="Scratch">I‚Äôm what?</h>
<h class="character">KELLY </h>
<h class="Scratch">You‚Äôre Mercury, Messenger to the gods.</h>
<h class="character">TECHIYA </h>
<h class="Scratch">Who are you, the girl with the clue?</h>
<h class="character">FLAVIA </h>
<h class="Scratch">I‚Äôm Flavia. I am on your team. I am a Messenger as well.</h>
<h class="character">TECHIYA </h>
<h class="Scratch">I do exclaim, I think we‚Äôre in the game!</h>
<h class="character">FAYE </h>
<h class="Scratch">But that‚Äôs not possible. We‚Äôre humans, not characters.</h>
<h class="character">FLAVIA </h>
<h class="Scratch">How dare you. I may be but a lowly Messenger but I am still a person.</h>
<h class="character">TECHIYA </h>
<h class="Scratch">I think we must play, in order to return to our own day.</h>
<h class="character">FLAVIA </h>
<h class="Scratch">Why are you singing?</h>
<h class="character">TECHIYA </h>
<h class="Scratch">I don‚Äôt know, please just let it go.</h>
<h class="character">FLAVIA </h>
<h class="Scratch">Weird. Anyway, I have been waiting for you. We must see Jupiter right away. He has a task for us. He hates it when we are late.</h>
<h class="Stage">Flavia starts walking.</h>
<h class="character">FAYE </h>
<h class="Scratch">Techiya, I think you‚Äôre right. I think we are in our own game. And I think that just like our characters, if we don‚Äôt do things right, we won‚Äôt survive it.</h>
<h class="character">TECHIYA </h>
<h class="Scratch">I told you to keep an infinite life supply, to never let our characters die!</h>
<h class="character">FAYE </h>
<h class="Scratch">Well yeah, hindsight‚Äôs twenty-twenty.</h>
<h class="character">FLAVIA </h>
<h class="Scratch">Come on, he is very loose with the lightening bolts.</h>
<h class="character">FAYE </h>
<h class="Scratch">Coming. All right, Techiya. This is our only chance.</h>
<h class="character">TECHIYA </h>
<h class="Scratch">I‚Äôll help you to get free, but next time you will listen to me!</h>
<h class="Stage">Jupiter is sitting in his throne talking to Neptune and Apollo.</h>
<h class="character">JUPITER </h>
<h class="Scratch">Everyone thinks just because I‚Äôm the King of the Gods that I must be so tough. They think just because I killed my father who swallowed me whole then I must be made of stone. I mean, I have feelings too, you know. When Hades taunts me and makes fun of how yes, I am at times a little clumsy, I mean it hurts.</h>
<h class="character">NEPTUNE </h>
<h class="Scratch">Hmm, but this is good, that you‚Äôre talking about it.</h>
<h class="character">JUPITER </h>
<h class="Scratch">It is, I just keep it all bottled up and-</h>
<h class="character">FLAVIA </h>
<h class="Scratch">We‚Äôre here, sir. Mercury‚Äôs Messengers have arrived.</h>
<h class="character">JUPITER </h>
<h class="Scratch">Oh, uh, right yes. Well it‚Äôs about time.</h>
<h class="character">FLAVIA </h>
<h class="Scratch">Apologies, sir.</h>
<h class="character">JUPITER </h>
<h class="Scratch">Yes, well. I‚Äôll spare your life, this time. </h>
<h class="Parenthetical">(beat)</h>
<h class="Scratch"> Mercury, I have a need for your services. Will you obey?</h>
<h class="Stage">Faye and Techiya stand silent. Flavia elbows Faye.</h>
<h class="character">FLAVIA </h>
<h class="Parenthetical">(to Faye)</h>
<h class="Scratch"> He‚Äôs talking to you.</h>
<h class="character">FAYE </h>
<h class="Scratch">Oh yeah. Yes, Jupiter, we are ready.</h>
<h class="character">JUPITER </h>
<h class="Scratch">Good. I require a new lightening bolt holder from Vulcanus. My current one keeps sparking.</h>
<h class="character">FAYE </h>
<h class="Scratch">And how are we going to get it?</h>
<h class="character">JUPITER </h>
<h class="Scratch">You‚Äôre the Messenger, you figure it out.</h>
<h class="character">FLAVIA </h>
<h class="Scratch">Don‚Äôt worry, Mercury, I have the maps.</h>
<h class="character">TECHIYA </h>
<h class="Scratch">We should leave now without delay, for I think he lives quite far away.</h>
<h class="character">JUPITER </h>
<h class="Scratch">Do this and you will be rewarded well.</h>
<h class="character">FAYE </h>
<h class="Scratch">A return home?</h>
<h class="character">JUPITER</h>
<h class="Scratch">Argh, so many questions, why can‚Äôt you just do the simplest of things-</h>
<h class="character">APOLLO </h>
<h class="Scratch">Now Jupiter, we talked about this-</h>
<h class="character">JUPITER </h>
<h class="Scratch">But she‚Äôs, gar she just argh ugh argh-</h>
<h class="character">APOLLO </h>
<h class="Scratch">Use your words-</h>
<h class="character">JUPITER </h>
<h class="Scratch">Fine. Mercury, since I‚Äôm working on my anger, I shall not immediately strike you down with a lightening bolt. Instead, I will allow you to complete this task and get back in my good graces. You have exactly one hour to get me my new lightening bolt holder or else you will no longer be welcome on Mount Olympus.</h>
<h class="character">APOLLO </h>
<h class="Scratch">Good job.</h>
<h class="character">JUPITER </h>
<h class="Scratch">Thank you.</h>
<h class="Stage">Faye, Techiya, and Flavia set out. Flavia looks at her map to determine where to go.</h>
<h class="character">FLAVIA </h>
<h class="Scratch">Okay, so it‚Äôs a bit tricky. According to this map, it‚Äôs practically a maze.</h>
<h class="character">TECHIYA </h>
<h class="Scratch">Tricky or no, we still must go.</h>
<h class="character">FAYE</h>
<h class="Parenthetical">(looking at the map)</h>
<h class="Scratch"> All right, guys. All we have to do is get through a complex, puzzle-like pathway, avoid robbers, thieves, and miscreants, crevices in the mountains, avalanches, floods, quick streams, and a few mythical creatures who could eat us up in one quick bite. What could possibly go wrong?</h>
<h class="Stage">Blackout. Lights up. A maze has been constructed around the entire room, weaving through the audience. Faye, Techiya, and Flavia must navigate through it before reaching VULCANUS.</h>
<h class="character">FAYE </h>
<h class="Scratch">Boy, this is one complex maze.</h>
<h class="character">FLAVIA </h>
<h class="Scratch">Don‚Äôt worry, I have the map. As long as we avoid danger, we should be all right.</h>
<h class="Stage">They go through the maze to the laire of Vulcanus.</h>
<h class="character">FAYE </h>
<h class="Scratch">Do we knock?</h>
<h class="character">VULCANUS </h>
<h class="Parenthetical">(still unseen)</h>
<h class="Scratch"> Who goes there?</h>
<h class="character">FAYE </h>
<h class="Scratch">It is me, Faye.</h>
<h class="character">VULCANUS AND FLAVIA </h>
<h class="Scratch">Who?</h>
<h class="character">FAYE </h>
<h class="Scratch">I mean Mercury, it is me, Mercury.</h>
<h class="character">VULCANUS </h>
<h class="Scratch">Oh, you must be here for the lightening bolt holder.</h>
<h class="character">TECHIYA </h>
<h class="Scratch">We came to get the pack, so we can now bring it back.</h>
<h class="character">VULCANUS </h>
<h class="Scratch">You know, it took me two months to make this.</h>
<h class="Stage">He hands the lightening bolt holder to Faye.</h>
<h class="character">FAYE </h>
<h class="Scratch">It‚Äôs wonderful craftsmanship.</h>
<h class="character">FLAVIA</h>
<h class="Scratch">Really shiny.</h>
<h class="character">VULCANUS </h>
<h class="Scratch">I made it just for my dad. You know Jupiter? Yeah, that‚Äôs him.</h>
<h class="character">FLAVIA </h>
<h class="Parenthetical">(to Faye and Techiya)</h>
<h class="Scratch"> He does this every time.</h>
<h class="character">VULCANUS </h>
<h class="Scratch">Yeah, I guess you could say he‚Äôs a pretty great dad...to his other fifty seven children. He‚Äôs never come to see me, though. Oh sure, he‚Äôll visit Neptune and hang out with Apollo-</h>
<h class="character">FLAVIA </h>
<h class="Parenthetical">(to Faye and Techiya, while Vulcanus is still talking)</h>
<h class="Scratch"> We should really just go. He‚Äôll be like this all day if we don‚Äôt leave.</h>
<h class="character">VULCANUS </h>
<h class="Scratch">-but does he want to see his son who makes him all those lightening bolts he cherishes so much? Noooo. Nope, he‚Äôs too busy. Yeah, too busy drinking ambrosia and cavorting about with the gods.</h>
<h class="Stage">Flavia, Techiya, and Faye all back away slowly and go on their way. Vulcanus continues his complaints.</h>
<h class="character">VULCANUS (continued)</h>
<h class="Scratch">And don‚Äôt even get me started on my mother. Do you know how many metal headdresses I‚Äôve had to make for her? And does she ever send me a thank you note? No, take take take is all these people do- Hey, where‚Äôd everybody go?</h>
<h class="Stage">Blackout. Lights up. Faye, Techiya, and Flavia are in front of Jupiter, Apollo, and Cupid delivering the package.</h>
<h class="character">JUPITER </h>
<h class="Scratch">Very good. You‚Äôve done well. That only took you five minutes out of sixty.</h>
<h class="character">FAYE </h>
<h class="Scratch">Yes, it felt a lot faster than I had expected.</h>
<h class="character">JUPITER </h>
<h class="Scratch">Well I am all set for now, but my fellow gods have a few tasks for you.</h>
<h class="character">FAYE </h>
<h class="Scratch">Shoot.</h>
<h class="Stage">CUPID misfires an arrow at her.</h>
<h class="character">JUPITER </h>
<h class="Scratch">She meant the idiom, you fool. And you can‚Äôt even strike your target? Get out of here.</h>
<h class="Stage">Cupid dejectedly walks away.</h>
<h class="character">APOLLO </h>
<h class="Scratch">Anywho. As you know, I am Apollo, god of the sun. As Spring is upon us, I wanted to have a festival. I have Bacchus for the food and drink, Aphrodite for the decorations, but the one thing I lack is entertainment. I would like for you to create one signature song and dance for the fairies and nymphs to perform at the festival.</h>
<h class="character">FAYE </h>
<h class="Scratch">Of course, whatever you need.</h>
<h class="character">APOLLO </h>
<h class="Scratch">Thank you. You have ten minutes.</h>
<h class="character">FAYE AND FLAVIA AND TECHIYA </h>
<h class="Scratch">Ten minutes!</h>
<h class="character">APOLLO </h>
<h class="Scratch">Nine and a half now.</h>
<h class="character">FLAVIA </h>
<h class="Parenthetical">(holding up the map)</h>
<h class="Scratch"> Let‚Äôs go, guys. There are some instruments at the bottom of the mountain we can use.</h>
<h class="Stage">Blackout. Lights up. Techiya, Faye, and Flavia are working on their song and dance. PLUTO, god of the underworld interrupts them.</h>
<h class="character">PLUTO </h>
<h class="Scratch">What about step ball change and one and two and three-</h>
<h class="character">FLAVIA </h>
<h class="Scratch">Gasp! It‚Äôs Pluto.</h>
<h class="character">PLUTO </h>
<h class="Scratch">I do so love how up here, everybody knows my name. I also love that everyone cowers in fear when it‚Äôs mentioned!</h>
<h class="character">FAYE </h>
<h class="Scratch">Who is this guy?</h>
<h class="character">FLAVIA </h>
<h class="Scratch">Faye, no!</h>
<h class="character">PLUTO </h>
<h class="Scratch">How dare you! I am the god of the underworld and I have a right mind to send you down there to rot for eternity.</h>
<h class="character">FLAVIA </h>
<h class="Scratch">She didn‚Äôt mean it, she‚Äôs a regular jokester like that.</h>
<h class="character">PLUTO </h>
<h class="Scratch">Hmm. I don‚Äôt find it very funny, but then again, I have found that not many people share my scintillating wit and brilliant humor.</h>
<h class="character">FLAVIA </h>
<h class="Scratch">What do you want? We‚Äôre just trying to write a song and dance for Apollo.</h>
<h class="character">PLUTO </h>
<h class="Scratch">Hmm, what do I want, what do I want. You know what? I don‚Äôt want anything. Except to make you miserable, of course. I am going to give you three riddles to solve. Solve all of them, you can continue what you were doing. Fail to do so, and join me in the underworld.</h>
<h class="character">FAYE </h>
<h class="Scratch">Fine. We‚Äôll take the chance. What‚Äôs the riddle?</h>
<h class="character">PLUTO </h>
<h class="Parenthetical">(takes out a poster board with the questions written on it)</h>
<h class="Scratch"> Riddle number one: ‚ÄúThere are three brothers in this world that were all born together. The first runs and never wearies. The second eats and is never full. The third drinks and is always thirsty. The fourth sings a song that is never good.‚Äù What are these four brothers? Riddle number two: ‚ÄúGive me food, and I will live; give me water, and I will die. What am I?‚Äù Riddle number three: ‚ÄúThe man who invented it doesn‚Äôt want it. The man who bought it doesn‚Äôt need it. The man who needs it doesn‚Äôt know it. What is it?‚Äù You may take a moment to figure it out. But take too long and you‚Äôre coming downstairs with me.</h>
<h class="Stage">Faye, Techiya, and Flavia huddle together, writing their answers on the poster board as they figure them out. They move away from the poster board revealing the correct answers: 1) Earth, Wind, Fire, Water; 2) fire; 3) a coffin. </h>
<h class="character">PLUTO (continued) </h>
<h class="Scratch">Darn it! Those are all correct. Fine. You can go back to doing your song and dance or whatever it was. I have more mayham to cause. Excuse me.</h>
<h class="Stage">The girls return to their song and dance and finish the assignment. They then perform it for Apollo.</h>
<h class="character">APOLLO </h>
<h class="Scratch">I love it! I absolutely love it.</h>
<h class="character">FLAVIA </h>
<h class="Scratch">Thanks.</h>
<h class="character">APOLLO </h>
<h class="Scratch">I‚Äôll definitely make sure you‚Äôre given credit at the festival. I mean, I‚Äôll say I came up with it and not ever mention your names, but you know, I‚Äôll be thinking of you. You‚Äôre good for now.</h>
<h class="Stage">Apollo turns back to talk to Jupiter while the girls stand confused.</h>
<h class="character">FAYE </h>
<h class="Scratch">Great, now we‚Äôll never get out of this game.</h>
<h class="character">FLAVIA </h>
<h class="Scratch">What game?</h>
<h class="character">FAYE </h>
<h class="Scratch">Argh, we are in a videogame!</h>
<h class="character">FLAVIA </h>
<h class="Scratch">A video what?</h>
<h class="character">FAYE </h>
<h class="Scratch">Ugh, this is ridiculous. We‚Äôre obviously going to be trapped in here forever with no way of ever getting out. At least the footwear is comfy.</h>
<h class="Stage">Jupiter receives a paper airplane note.</h>
<h class="character">JUPITER </h>
<h class="Scratch">What has he done now. </h>
<h class="Parenthetical">(shows the paper to Apollo)</h>
<h class="Scratch"> Can you believe this guy? Really, now. All right, Mercury‚Äôs Messengers. I have one final task for you.</h>
<h class="character">FAYE </h>
<h class="Scratch">A final task?</h>
<h class="character">JUPITER</h>
<h class="Scratch">Yes, one with the greatest reward you could ever receive.</h>
<h class="character">FLAVIA </h>
<h class="Scratch">What is it?</h>
<h class="character">JUPITER </h>
<h class="Scratch">My foolish brother Neptune has a bit of a temper, but honestly I don‚Äôt know where he gets it from, I‚Äôm so even-keeled.</h>
<h class="character">APOLLO </h>
<h class="Scratch">Yeah...</h>
<h class="character">JUPITER </h>
<h class="Scratch">Anyways, he‚Äôs gone and shipwrecked an entire crew. Normally, I wouldn‚Äôt care about mere mortals, but they‚Äôve got a ye old Guarino‚Äôs cake, and I am not about to let that go down. Bring it to me and you can go home.</h>
<h class="character">FLAVIA </h>
<h class="Scratch">But this is our home.</h>
<h class="Stage">Jupiter looks knowingly at Faye and Techiya.</h>
<h class="character">JUPITER </h>
<h class="Scratch">Go now or I‚Äôll keep you here forever.</h>
<h class="character">TECHIYA </h>
<h class="Scratch">Let us go and finish the show! I mean game!</h>
<h class="character">FAYE </h>
<h class="Scratch">Don‚Äôt give away the plot, Techiya. Amateur.</h>
<h class="character">FLAVIA </h>
<h class="Scratch">Come on, guys. We have a cake to rescue! And some crew guys, but whatever. I am really just in it for the cake.</h>
<h class="Stage">They leave. Blackout. Lights up. Flavia, Faye, and Techiya arrive at the foamy shores of the Mediterranean. They can hear the men calling for help, but do not know what to do.</h>
<h class="character">FLAVIA </h>
<h class="Scratch">I don‚Äôt know, guys. The map just shows an ocean, not a way to get out there.</h>
<h class="character">TECHIYA </h>
<h class="Scratch">Our planning can‚Äôt be sloppy, because this water‚Äôs pretty choppy.</h>
<h class="character">FLAVIA </h>
<h class="Scratch">We can build a boat out of this tree here, but I don‚Äôt see how we can get it out there. There are sea monsters, dangerous riptides trenches that we could get trapped in. Plus, the water‚Äôs really cold.</h>
<h class="character">FAYE </h>
<h class="Scratch">Don‚Äôt worry, guys. This is what I‚Äôve been training for all my life.</h>
<h class="character">FLAVIA</h>
<h class="Scratch">You can swim?</h>
<h class="character">FAYE </h>
<h class="Scratch">Of course, I‚Äôm a championship swimmer back home in Norwood.</h>
<h class="character">FLAVIA </h>
<h class="Scratch">Norwood. Is that near Mesopotamia?</h>
<h class="character">FAYE </h>
<h class="Scratch">No, it‚Äôs a land farther away than you could even imagine.</h>
<h class="character">FLAVIA </h>
<h class="Scratch">So...not Sicily?</h>
<h class="character">FAYE </h>
<h class="Scratch">All right, here‚Äôs the plan. I‚Äôm going to swim out there, pull in the boat, and rescue the cake. Easy, right?</h>
<h class="character">FLAVIA </h>
<h class="Scratch">It‚Äôs never as easy as it looks, Mercury.</h>
<h class="character">FAYE </h>
<h class="Scratch">It‚Äôll be all right. What could possibly go wrong?</h>
<h class="Stage">Faye starts to swim, Neptune pops up. Faye must tread water to stay alive.</h>
<h class="character">NEPTUNE </h>
<h class="Scratch">Really, Mercury, you thought it was going to be that simple? Aren‚Äôt you the confident one.</h>
<h class="character">FAYE </h>
<h class="Scratch">What are you doing down here? Shouldn‚Äôt you be up on your mountaintop preparing for Apollo‚Äôs festival?</h>
<h class="character">NEPTUNE </h>
<h class="Scratch">I should, but I thought causing massive destruction to an innocent ship and its sailors would be a lot more fun. Do you actually think you can swim out there tugging that big boat behind you? You‚Äôre already looking a little tired.</h>
<h class="character">FAYE </h>
<h class="Scratch">I‚Äôm fine. In fact, I‚Äôm better than fine. I‚Äôm fabulous. Why wouldn‚Äôt I be, I‚Äôm Faye.</h>
<h class="character">NEPTUNE </h>
<h class="Scratch">What‚Äôs a Faye?</h>
<h class="character">FAYE </h>
<h class="Scratch">Just get out of my way, Neptune. I‚Äôve got a job to do.</h>
<h class="character">NEPTUNE </h>
<h class="Scratch">Wait a minute, you can‚Äôt just-</h>
<h class="Stage">Faye pushes Neptune out of the way and continues to swim.</h>
<h class="character">NEPTUNE (continued)</h>
<h class="Scratch">Ouch, cheap shot! Fine, I‚Äôll let you pass, but this is going to be the hardest swim of your life!</h>
<h class="Stage">Neptune points her staff at the sea and the waves get wild, making Faye‚Äôs challenge as difficult as swimming the English Channel. She makes it, though, and rescues the cake.</h>
<h class="character">FAYE </h>
<h class="Scratch">Come on, boys. Here‚Äôs your boat. I‚Äôll drag you back, since you‚Äôre obviously useless now. Hey, sticky fingers, hands off my cake.</h>
<h class="Stage">Faye swims back to shore with her cake in hand.</h>
<h class="character">FAYE (continued)</h>
<h class="Scratch">You‚Äôre welcome, boys.</h>
<h class="character">FLAVIA </h>
<h class="Scratch">My goodness, you must be tired.</h>
<h class="character">FAYE </h>
<h class="Scratch">Yeah, I really am.</h>
<h class="Stage">Faye hands Techiya the cake, then collapses.</h>
<h class="character">TECHIYA </h>
<h class="Scratch">No, Faye, get up my friend! We‚Äôre on a journey that‚Äôs about to end!</h>
<h class="character">FAYE </h>
<h class="Scratch">I can‚Äôt. Go on without me, I‚Äôm just too tired.</h>
<h class="character">FLAVIA </h>
<h class="Scratch">Not a chance. Here at Mercury‚Äôs Messengers, we leave no messenger behind, especially if it‚Äôs Mercury. Besides, who would run the business if we left you here?</h>
<h class="Stage">Flavia and Techiya pick up Faye and help her back to Mount Olympus. Blackout. Lights up. Techiya, Flavia, and Faye are once again in front of Jupiter. Faye is near dead from exhaustion.</h>
<h class="character">FLAVIA </h>
<h class="Scratch">Here is your cake, sir. Please, be kind and help my boss. She has done so much to get this baked good. She does not deserve this fate, even if it is Guarino‚Äôs.</h>
<h class="character">JUPITER </h>
<h class="Scratch">I have something that might make her better. Techiya, you look weary. You might like this as well.</h>
<h class="Stage">He pours Techiya and Faye ambrosia.</h>
<h class="character">JUPITER (continued)</h>
<h class="Scratch">To the Messengers, who have sacrificed so much of themselves to bring me my spoils. Cheers.</h>
<h class="Stage">Faye and Techiya drink their ambrosia. Faye collapses.</h>
<h class="character">TECHIYA </h>
<h class="Scratch">Faye! Faye! Oh no, my head feels funny too, what‚Äôs happening? Faye!</h>
<h class="Stage">The lights flicker. Blackout. Lights up. Techiya and Faye are back at their studio.</h>
<h class="character">TECHIYA </h>
<h class="Scratch">Well that was certainly the weirdest thing that‚Äôs ever happened to me.</h>
<h class="character">FAYE </h>
<h class="Scratch">Hey, you‚Äôre not singing anymore.</h>
<h class="character">TECHIYA </h>
<h class="Scratch">Oh yeah. Thank goodness, I don‚Äôt want any vocal damage before my sold-out concert next week.</h>
<h class="character">FAYE </h>
<h class="Scratch">Wow, it‚Äôs good to be home. I was worried we wouldn‚Äôt make it out of there, but here we are, in infinite bits and pixels, real life HD.</h>
<h class="character">TECHIYA </h>
<h class="Scratch">Yeah. I guess all that‚Äôs left is to send the game to Nintendo and make a killing.</h>
<h class="character">FAYE </h>
<h class="Scratch">Yeah, and just get back on with real life. Real problems, real tasks, and real work with no festivals to break up the day and no fun.</h>
<h class="character">TECHIYA </h>
<h class="Scratch">Say, we do have a little of that ambrosia leftover. But that would be crazy, right?</h>
<h class="character">FAYE </h>
<h class="Scratch">Yes, that would be absolutely mad. Going back into a video game? Psh. Now that is the most ridiculous thing I‚Äôve ever heard.</h>
<h class="Stage">They stare at the half-empty glasses of ambrosia. They pick them up.</h>
<h class="character">FAYE AND TECHIYA </h>
<h class="Scratch">Cheers!</h>
<h class="Stage _idGenParaOverride-1">Blackout. End of play. </h>
